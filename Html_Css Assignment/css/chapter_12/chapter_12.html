    <h1>PIAIC</h1>
    <h2>PRESIDENTIAL INITIATIVE FOR ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE AND COMPUTING</h2>
    <p>Presidential Initiative for Artificial Intelligence and Computing (PIAIC) is a privately funded not-for-profit educational initiative started by President of Pakistan, Dr. Arif Alvi, Kazi Rahat Ali, and Zia Khan to help promote education, research and business opportunities in emerging tech fields like:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><h4 id="cloud">Cloud Native Computing</h4></li>
        <li><h4>Artificial Intelligence</h4></li>
        <li><h4>Blockchain</h4></li>
        <li><h4>Internet of Things (IoT)</h4></li>
    </ul>
    <h3><b class="firstword">C</b>loud Native Computing:</h3>
    <p>The <b>Cloud Native Computing</b> program prepares students to program in open
        source technologies like <b>Linux, Docker, Kubernetes, JavaScript, Node.js,
        React and React Native</b> while introducing the students to the development 
        of Microservices and software development techniques on cloud platforms 
        like AWS.</p>
    <h3><b class="firstword">A</b>rtificial Intelligence:</h3>
    <p>The <b>artificial intelligence</b> program of PIAIC takes students through the 
        foundations of AI technology, via teaching programming in open-source 
        languages like <b>Python, Numpy, Pandas, TensorFlow 2.0, and Flask</b>, and
        focuses on deploying practical AI solutions and use cases, ending with 
        real-life examples of modern-day AI in practice.</p>
    <h3><b class="firstword">B</b>lockchain:</h3>
    <p>The main emphasis of the <b>Blockchain</b> program is to understand the blockchains like <b>Ethereum  and Hyperledger (Fabric),</b> 
        and Hyperledger (Fabric), and learn to program in languages such as Solidity, JavaScript
        on frameworks like Node.js. The program also introduces them to the development of Distributed
        Apps (DApps), frameworks like Web3 and Truffle, and an in-depth understanding of Blockchain-as-a-service
       (BaaS) and how to develop and offer an Initial Coin Offering (ICO) of a crypto-token.</p>
       
       <h3><b class="firstword">I</b>nternet of Things:</h3>
       <p>The <b>Internet of Things</b> program introduces the students to open-source 
        development technologies like <b>Rust, Embedded Rust, WebAssembly, Hyper,
            Diesel, Google Assistant, and Kubernetes</b> while making them efficient in
        developing Micro Services for IoT Edge, IoT Cloud, and voice computing
        for device control.</p>
